# Minesweeper

Plays Bad Apple!! in Google Minesweeper.

Uses PyAutoGUI to read the board and figure out where flags are, then keeps track of the state of the board. Then uses Pillow to read each frame and places flags for black, and keeps the tiles empty for white. It will then save a screenshot of the frame.

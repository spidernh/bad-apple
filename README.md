# Bad Apple!! player

This repository contains multiple programs I have written to play Bad Apple!! other than just playing it on YouTube.

## Python Terminal

Plays Bad Apple!! in a python terminal.

Uses OpenCV to get the frame from the video, converts that frame into a smaller black & white image that would fit on the terminal, then displays it using either a '#' or a ' ' representing black and white respectively.

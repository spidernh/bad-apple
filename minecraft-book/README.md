# Minecraft Book

Plays Bad Apple!! in a Minecraft book.

Uses Pillow to read each frame, then goes through the frame and types it into the book using the characters '#' and ' '. It then screenshots and saves it before going to the next page. It will also get new books manually as books have a page cap of 100 pages.
